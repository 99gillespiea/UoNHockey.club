## Welcome to our reworked website!

Before I begin this post let me introduce myself.
My name is Alex Gillespie, Social Media Secretary for the club through the 2020/21 season.

With plenty of time on our hands to make changes, I, along with the help of a [bored former member of the club](https://www.pettey.co.uk), have taken it upon ourselves to rework the club website.
The main motivation behind this redevelopment was to provide a better way to keep those with an interest in the club up to date with developments on and off the pitch.
